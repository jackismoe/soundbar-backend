# SoundBar

- [x] Include at least one `has_many`, at least one `belongs_to`, and at least two `has_many :through` relationships
- [x] Include a `many-to-many` relationship implemented with `has_many :through` associations. The join table must include a user-submittable attribute â€” that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submittedby the app's user
- [x] Include reasonable validations for the simple attributes. Don't need to add every possible validation or duplicates, such as presence and a minimum length, but the models should defend against invalid data.
- [x] Include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope method. 
- [x] Scope method must be chainable; ActiveRecord Query methods within it (such as `.where` and `.order`) rather than native ruby methods (such as `#find_all` or `#sort`).
- [x] Application must provide standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords.
- [x] Authentication system must also allow login from some other service. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Github, etc...
- [x] Must include and make use of a nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs.
- [x] Must include a nested new route with form that relates to the parent resource
- [x] Must include a nested index or show route
- [x] Forms should correctly display validation errors.
- [x] Fields should be enclosed within a `fields_with_errors` class
- [x] Error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view.
- [x] Application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app.
- [x] Logic present in controllers should be encapsulated as methods in models.
- [x] Views should use helper methods and partials when appropriate.
- [x] Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby Style Guide.
Do not use scaffolding. The goal here is to learn. Learning a lot is not one of the benefits of scaffolding.
